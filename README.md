# Java8-features
Master the features included in Java8 (Lambda expression, Stream API, Optional, Method references).

This is a colleciton of Java8 examples and concepts, from basic to advanced. The idea is to understand the new functionnal features added to Java 8 starting of course by understanding the lambda expression and to have a deep understanding of other funcitons like Map, flatMap, etc.
